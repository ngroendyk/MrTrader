(Ubuntu/deb packages)


--BASE PROJECT DEPS--
libcurl4-gnutls-dev


--WORDNET DEPS--
(maybe needed... not 100%, try a vanilla build without)
tcl8.6 tk8.6 tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev

(Absolutely needed. Wordnet wouldnt build without... should fixits build to not use the gui deps, since we dont need them in this proj)
sudo apt-get install tcl tcl-dev tk tk-dev


--gumbo-parser deps--
(Not sure, forgot to keep track of them. Guess we will see in a vanilla distro test)
